-->

## Game Functionality

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

<!--
The following features can be implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[No outside resources were used]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission ? How did you overcome it?

[Initially, when I reviewed the pre-work required to apply to the SITE Program, I thought I would have to download some specialized IDE to develop web applications like Visual Studio Code or Atom. This would have involved more time and resources on my laptop; however, through the pre-work guidelines, I was able to learn about the Glitch.com website, which simplified the required web application development time significantly. On the other hand, when I was developing this project, at first I didn't understand the meaning of some keywords and peculiar rules used in the javascript's syntax; however, after carefully reading the documentation provided in the guide, I was able to understand the semantics of this programming language. In another instance, thoroughly understanding the logic used in the game was a challenge and a great motivation when developing this project. Due to my computer science classes, I have prior knowledge of the use of variables, data structures, and the interconnection of functions; however, employing the use of these components in a real-life case like the creation of this game was very beneficial in taking my knowledge to the next level. To understand the logic used in this program, I first focused on understanding why each variable, constant, and function were declared. Then, I observed and kept track of how the values of these variables were used and changed throughout the execution of each function. This way I was able to understand the logic behind the program. Undoubtedly, through the development of this program, I have increased my knowledge about web development and the use of algorithms]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission?

[After completing this project, my enthusiasm to further understand the syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript increased. On the other hand, I wonder what are the best practices when integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a project since I am interested in basing my style of web development on resource optimization. I'm also interested in understanding when I should use a robust web development IDE like Visual Studio and when I should use a web-based IDE like Glitch.com. Finally, I would like to understand the use of frameworks used in web development]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing?

[If I had extra hours to work on this project, I would focus on adding features to the game like different game patterns and different game levels. The game levels would be beginner, medium and advanced and would be based on showing the game pattern in less time causing more difficulty to remember a certain pattern. On the other hand, I would add a timer on the screen for the player to see how long it takes to complete a game and show the average time spent winning games. Another feature that I would like to implement in this game would be to show the percentage of games won and the percentage of games lost]
