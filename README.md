**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Diego Garcia-Carrasco**

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[No outside resources were used]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Initially, when I reviewed the pre-work required to apply to the SITE Program, I thought I would have to download some specialized IDE to develop web applications like Visual Studio Code or Atom. This would have involved more time and resources on my laptop; however, through the pre-work guidelines, I was able to learn about the Glitch.com website, which simplified the required web application development time significantly. On the other hand, when I was developing this project, at first I didn't understand the meaning of some keywords and peculiar rules used in the javascript's syntax; however, after carefully reading the documentation provided in the guide, I was able to understand the semantics of this programming language. In another instance, thoroughly understanding the logic used in the game was a challenge and a great motivation when developing this project. Due to my computer science classes, I have prior knowledge of the use of variables, data structures, and the interconnection of functions; however, employing the use of these components in a real-life case like the creation of this game was very beneficial in taking my knowledge to the next level. To understand the logic used in this program, I first focused on understanding why each variable, constant, and function were declared. Then, I observed and kept track of how the values of these variables were used and changed throughout the execution of each function. This way I was able to understand the logic behind the program. Undoubtedly, through the development of this program, I have increased my knowledge about web development and the use of algorithms.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing this project, my enthusiasm to further understand the syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript increased. On the other hand, I wonder what are the best practices when integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a project since I am interested in basing my style of web development on resource optimization. I'm also interested in understanding when I should use a robust web development IDE like Visual Studio and when I should use a web-based IDE like Glitch.com. Finally, I would like to understand the use of frameworks used in web development.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had extra hours to work on this project, I would focus on adding features to the game like the percentage of games won and the percentage of games lost. On the other hand, I would add a timer on the screen for the player to see the time it takes to finish the game and show the average time it takes for a certain player to finish the game]
